Some papers I write for some magazines.

To build them all you have to install Ruby, Bundle, and LaTeX. Then:

```bash
$ bundle update
$ bundle exec rake
```

Should compile them all into the `pdf` directory.

If doesn't work, don't hesitate to
[submit a ticket](https://github.com/yegor256/articles/issues).
